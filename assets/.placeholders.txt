This file exists to ensure the assets/ directory is committed even before adding real media.
Expected structure:
- assets/video/hero.mp4           (local placeholder video)
- assets/video/poster.jpg         (poster frame for the video)
- assets/og/og-image.png          (Open Graph / Twitter card)
- assets/icons/favicon.svg        (site favicon)

You can replace these placeholders at any time with real assets.
