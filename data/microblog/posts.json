        "html": "<article class=\"values-article\"><h3>Innocence — a Beginner’s Mindset</h3><p>Curiosity is my compass. I approach every project as if it were my first, free of bias, full of wonder, and open to possibility. This innocence fuels experimentation and keeps my work fresh, inviting a sense of discovery.</p><h3>Integrity — doing the right thing when no one’s watching</h3><p>My actions align with my words, and my decisions reflect my deepest beliefs, even when it's difficult or unpopular. I take ownership of my mistakes, honor my commitments, and speak truthfully with kindness. Integrity is my compass—it guides me when the path isn't clear and keeps me grounded in who I want to be.</p><h3>Care — design with empathy, craft with love</h3><p>Great experiences start with listening. As someone great said, “Amongst real people there are no hierarchies.” I cater to needs, contexts, and emotions, then build thoughtfully, prioritizing inclusivity and sustainability. Every small detail is a quiet act of care.</p><h3>Resilience — iterate, adapt, grow</h3><p>I've learned that resilience isn't about avoiding difficulty, but about developing the inner strength to navigate it with grace. I find ways to grow from setbacks, to maintain hope during uncertain times, and to support others facing their own struggles. Progress isn’t a straight line—it’s a resilient loop of learning.</p></article>"
